shift cipher find key given p and c
affine cipher find key given p and c
multiple solutions ax=b in Zn
number of keys in affine cipher is |Zn||Zn*|

all inverts in Zn should check with CRT. Euler function
chinese remainder theorem check e.g. 40(1-1/2)(1-1/5)

determinant of a sqare matrix !
matrix A is invertible iff det(A) is invertible
adjoint matrix of a square matrix
for any square matrix over any number system adj(M).M = M.adj(M)=...
if det(M) is invertible, then (det(M))^-1 * adj(M) = M^-1

invert matrix
transpose matrix
