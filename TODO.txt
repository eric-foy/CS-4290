shift cipher find key given p and c
affine cipher find key given p and c
multiple solutions ax=b in Zn
number of keys in affine cipher is |Zn||Zn*|

all inverts in Zn should check with CRT. Euler function
chinese remainder theorem check e.g. 40(1-1/2)(1-1/5)

zero matrix
vigenere cipher
substitiution cipher
product cipher
