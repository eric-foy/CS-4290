shift cipher find key given p and c
affine cipher find key given p and c
multiple solutions ax=b in Zn
number of keys in affine cipher is |Zn||Zn*|

all inverts in Zn should check with CRT. Euler function
chinese remainder theorem check e.g. 40(1-1/2)(1-1/5)

matrix scripts support modular numbers !

for any square matrix over any number system adj(M).M = M.adj(M)=...
if det(M) is invertible, then (det(M))^-1 * adj(M) = M^-1
Hill cipher !

zero matrix
invert matrix
transpose matrix
vigenere cipher
substitiution cipher
